    <h2>Part 1: Web and HTML Basics</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h3>Worldwide Web</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Invented in the early 1990's, today the worldwide web has nearly 30 billion web pages</li>
        <li>The worldwide web is a collection of HTML documents</li>
        <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language and it's the basis of almost every web page</li>
        <li>URL: Uniform Resource Locators, most commonly used to reference a web page</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks: Links between pages that make the web, web-like</li>
        <li>Web applications: Software that runs in a web browser that is created in a browser-supported programming language (such as the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS) and relies on a web browser to render the application</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

<div>
     <h3>Pieces of the Web - Major Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet: World's largest computer network</li>
        <li>HTTP: Main protocol of the web that communicates between the internet and the servers</li>
        <li>Servers: Computers that host the files that make up the web</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>The Pieces of HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h3>  
  <ul>
        <li>Text content: What you see</li>
        <li>Markup: What it looks like (tells the web browser how to display the words and images of a web page)</li>
        <li>References: Access to other documents like images or videos</li>
        <li>Links: Redirect to other pages</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>HTML Tag Overview</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>There are opening and closing tags (the name of both tags are always the same)</li>
        <li>Opening tags are surrounded by a less than and greater than symbol</li>
        <li>Closing tags are identical to the opening tag with the addition of a slash in front of the tag name</li>
        <li>An element is comprised of the opening and closing tag with the content in between</li>
        <li>Leaving off the end tag creates a element that never ends</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>Basic HTML Tags</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>Anchors: Provide the ability to create a link that when clicked on goes to a web page</li>
        <li>Line Break: An inline void tag which requires no end tag and makes text appear on multiple lines. Without a line break or a paragraph break, all content in HTML appears on a single line (whitespace)</li>
        <li>Paragraph: A method to create an invisible box arount the content which can have both height and width</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>Inline Elements: Bold, Italic, Image, Href (to insert a link), Strong, Span, Break</li>
        <li>Block elements: Used to create an imaginary box around the content - Paragraph, Form, Div (all this does is contain its contents)</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Part 2: Web Page Structure Basics</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h3>Web Document Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is the language of the web with the syntax and rules - think of it as the walls of the house. The "words" of HTML are the tags. There are opening tags and closing tags and everything in between is known as the content</li>
      <li>Each HTML tag creates a series of nested elements that are a tree-like structure know as the DOM tree (Document Object Model tree)</li>
        <li>CSS is the design/style of the web - think of it as the color of the walls and the carpet</li>
        <li>Javascript files are the interactive components - think of it as the garage door opener or tv remote</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>Web Pages are Made of Boxes</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>Web pages can be deconstructed into boxes (even a circle is truly a box)</li>
        <li>When given a page design, start by determining where the boxes on the page are located from largest to smallest. Worry about the design and placement of the boxes later</li>
        <li>Div tags are used to define the boxes</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="parts">

    <h2>Part 3: Adding Design to Web Pages </h2>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h3>CSS adds "style" to HTML documents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows the use of specific syntax and rules to change how elements appear on the page</li>
        <li>Provides the ability to control the HTML content by telling the HTML how it should look</li>
        <li>CSS Selector = How to look all of the time (Apply the rules to every h1 element)</li>
        <li>CSS Class Selectors = How to look some of the time (Apply the rules to certain h1 elements)</li>
        <li>Including CSS for a web page can be included in the head of the html, with a link in the HTML to a separate CSS file, or written inline with the HTML (not recommended)</li>
      </ul>
</div>

<div>
      <h3>Why Avoid Repetition?</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>Saves time by alleviating the need update code in multiple places</li>
        <li>CSS styles can be updated all at once</li>
        <li>Helps avoid the likelihood that updates will be missed and mistakes will be made</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
